My previous research and publications focused on using AI in various areas like **medical imaging**, **healthcare systems**, **Internet of Things**, and **smart networks**. I worked on projects such as detecting diseases from medical scans using UNet and Transformers, improving healthcare, and optimizing smart networks using Federated Learning.

Currently, my main research looks at how AI can solve challenges in Economics. For example, by analyzing data to predict economic risks or detect early signs of financial instability or financial stress.

If you're interested in working together or need support with research in these areas, feel free to [contact me](/contact).
