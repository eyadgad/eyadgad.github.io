During my time at Nile University, I worked as a **Intern Researcher** at the [Center for Informatics Sciences](https://www.cis.nu.edu.eg/), supervised by [Dr. Sahar Selim](https://nu.edu.eg/academic-staff/dr-sahar-selim) and [Dr. Mustafa Elattar](https://www.nu.edu.eg/academic-staff/dr-mustafa-elattar).

My research interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence** and its applications in:
