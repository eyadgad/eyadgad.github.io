I am a Researcher & Data Scientist at [NORDIK Institute](https://nordikinstitute.com).

I hold **Masterâ€™s in Computer Science** at [The University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Zubair Fadlullah](https://www.zfadlullah.org/home), and **Bachelor's in Computer Engineering** from [Nile University](https://www.nu.edu.eg/), supervised by [Prof. Mohamed Darweesh](https://www.nu.edu.eg/academic-staff/dr-mohamed-s-darweesh).

My research interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence** and its applications in Internet of Things, medical imaging, Smart networks and security.

Beyond my academic work, I enjoy being physically active through walking, running and cycling. I also enjoy listening to Rock, Metal, and Classical music
